 * Converts a PDF file to PNG images, one per page.
 *
 * @param pdfFile - The PDF file to convert. Can be a file path (string) or an ArrayBufferLike.
 * @param props - Optional configuration options for the conversion process.
 * @returns A promise that resolves to an array of `PngPageOutput` objects, each representing a PNG image of a PDF page.
 *
 * @remarks
 * - If `pdfFile` is a string, it is treated as a file path and read from disk.
 * - The `props.pagesToProcess` option allows specifying which pages to convert (1-based indices).
 * - The `props.viewportScale` option controls the rendering scale of the PDF pages.
 * - The `props.outputFileMaskFunc` option allows customizing the output file name for each page.
 * - If `props.outputFolder` is provided, the PNG files are saved to the specified folder.
 * - The function processes pages in parallel for efficiency.
 * - All resources are cleaned up after processing.
 *
 * @throws Will throw if the PDF file cannot be read or processed.
